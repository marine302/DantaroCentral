## Benefits of New Structure
1. **Categorized**: Documents are logically grouped by purpose
2. **Discoverable**: Each category has its own README with file listings
3. **Maintainable**: Clear structure makes it easy to find and update docs
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add new categories or files as the project grows

## Next Steps
1. Review the organized documentation for accuracy
2. Update any cross-references between documents
3. Consider adding more detailed documentation where needed
4. Maintain the structure as new documentation is added
